If you ssh onto the pi and go into /home/pi/classifier-pipeline directory, 
then run 'git checkout signals'

I have added a script https://github.com/TheCacophonyProject/classifier-pipeline/blob/signals/dbustest.py 
which sets up the dbus signals and receives tracking events in"catchall_tracking_signals_handler" method .

 Let me know if that all makes sense, may need to add some more events for you? 
Like when it has stopped tracking a track?
